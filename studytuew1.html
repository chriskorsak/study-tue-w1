    <h1>Week 1 Tuesday Study</h1>
    <h2>Things I've learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Get my laptop ready to code</li>
      <li>Command line practice</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Github</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think all this will get easier as I keep practicing, but for right now, it's a lot to remember!</p>
    <p>So, I'd like to add one more bit of text. I am using this addition to practice doing another git commit.</p>
    <h2>Final test to see if I got it</h2>
    <p>So here's what I did: I pushed code to github, and then deleted it on my local computer. I then cloned the repo from github on my local computer. Now, these are additional changes that I'm adding! All is well if I can push these changes back to github....</p>
